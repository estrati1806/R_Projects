# Introduction
Hello! 👋 

My name is Emi Strati and I am passionate about data analytics and science. Here you will find a bunch of my projects and experiments, where I showcase different tools and methodologies. I have uploaded examples of what I can do with R for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. A couple of these projects are also published on RPubs where they are accompanied with longer descriptions to explain my process. I also have included SQL examples and an instance of web scraping using Python. 

I am currently working on more projects which I will add here soon. 😊

## Data Analysis & Visualization

| Project Name  | Methodology   | Link | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- |------|-------------|
| Starbucks Food Menu Items EDA | R - dplyr & ggplot2| [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/R_Projects/blob/main/SbuxEDA.Rmd) [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emistrati/StarbucksEDA) | Exploratory data analysis of 77 Starbucks food menu items using dplyr and ggplot. |
| Choropleth Map for ZIP Codes | R - Choropleth | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction/Choropleth%20Map%20in%20R.R) | Geospatial visualization of average house price per ZIP based on 4600 houses in WA. [Click here for map.](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction/Choropleth%20Map%20-%20Average%20House%20Price%20per%20ZIP%20Code.png)|

## Machine Learning

| Project Name | Methodology | Link | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------|------------|
|Cardiovascular Disease Classification | R - Logistic Regression, kNN and Decision Trees | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/Cardiovascular_Disease_Classification/Cardiovascular%20Disease%20Classification.R) [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emistrati/CardiovascularDiseaseClassification)| Conducted classification analysis with 3 different models on a dataset of 70k data instances achieving 91% accuracy. Explored the data and performed feature engineering. |
| Mall Customer Segmentation | R - K-Means Clustering | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/Mall%20Customer%20Segmentation/Mall%20Customers%20K-Means%20Clustering.R) [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emistrati/MallSegmentationKMC)| Implemented a kMC algorithm to segment customers into 6 clusters. Identified customers and provided tips on how to cater to them. Low WSS and 77.7% BSS/TSS ratio. |

## Financial Applications
| Project Name  | Methodology  | Link  | Description  |
|---------------|--------------|-------|--------------|
|Robo-Advisor Simulation | Python | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/Robo%20Advisor%20Simulation/Robo_Advisor_Simulation.ipynb) | This Python code simulates a simple robo-advisor. A robo-advisor is a digital platform that provides automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human intervention. This simulation takes a user's risk appetite as input (low, medium, or high) and recommends a portfolio distribution between stocks and bonds. |

## Web Scraping

| Project Name  |Methodology | Link   | Description  |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------------|
|GoodReads Web Scraper | Python - Beautiful Soup | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/GoodReads_Web_Scraping/GoodReads%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb) | Scrapes data from the "Best Philosophical Fiction" list on GoodReads and compiles it into a csv file ([Philosophical Books.csv](GoodReads_Web_Scraping/philosophical_books.csv)) for further analysis. |

## SQL Projects

|Project Name | Link | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
|GoodReads List SQL Script| [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/GoodReads_Web_Scraping/Philosophical_Books_SQL.sql)|Wrote a SQL script to create a table, load the scraped GoodReads data into the new table, and then query the said table. |
|Reporting in SQL - Examples | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Reporting%20in%20SQL%20-%20Examples)|SQL Reporting examples completed in DataCamp's "Reporting in SQL" course.|
