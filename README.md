# Introduction
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Emi Strati and I am passionate about data analytics and science. Here you will find a bunch of my projects and experiments, where I showcase different tools and methodologies. I have uploaded examples of what I can do with R for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models. A couple of these projects are also published on RPubs where they are accompanied with longer descriptions to explain my process.

I also have included SQL examples and an instance of web scraping using Python. I am constantly updating this portfolio with more projects and will soon link Tableau Dashboards. ðŸ˜Š

| Choropleth Map for ZIP Codes | R - Choropleth | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction/Choropleth%20Map%20in%20R.R) | Geospatial visualization of average house price per ZIP based on 4600 houses in WA. [Click here for map.](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction/Choropleth%20Map%20-%20Average%20House%20Price%20per%20ZIP%20Code.png)|

## Machine Learning

| Project Name | Methodology | Link | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------|------------|
|Cardiovascular Disease Classification | R - Logistic Regression, kNN and Decision Trees | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/Cardiovascular_Disease_Classification/Cardiovascular%20Disease%20Classification.R) [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/emistrati/CardiovascularDiseaseClassification)| Conducted classification analysis with 3 different models on a dataset of 70k data instances achieving 91% accuracy. Explored the data and performed feature engineering. |
|Image Recognition|YOLO (You Only Look Once) | [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/YOLO%20Image%20Detection%20-%20Cat%20Image.R)| Experimented with image classification and detection using the image.darknet package from the BNOSAC repository.|

## Web Scraping

| Project Name  |Methodology | Link   | Description  |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------------|
|GoodReads Web Scraper | Python - Beautiful Soup | [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/GoodReads_Web_Scraping/GoodReads%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb) | Scrapes data from the "Best Philosophical Fiction" list on GoodReads and compiles it into a csv file ([Philosophical Books.csv](GoodReads_Web_Scraping/philosophical_books.csv)) for further analysis. |

## SQL Projects

|Project Name | Link | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
|GoodReads List SQL Script| [GitHub](https://github.com/estrati1806/estrati_portfolio/blob/main/GoodReads_Web_Scraping/Philosophical_Books_SQL.sql)|Wrote a SQL script to create a table, load the scraped GoodReads data into the new table, and then query the said table. |
